## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account (for hosting the automated workflow)
- Telegram account
- Telegram bot token (obtained from BotFather)
- Basic familiarity with GitHub

### Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Start a chat and send `/newbot` command
3. Follow the instructions to create your bot
4. **Important:** Save the API token BotFather provides (looks like `1234567890:ABCDefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`)

### Step 2: Get Your Chat ID

You need to determine where the job notifications should be sent:

#### For personal notifications:
1. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
2. It will reply with your personal chat ID

#### For a channel:
1. Create a channel in Telegram
2. Add your bot as an administrator to the channel
3. Get the channel ID (typically in format `-100xxxxxxxxxx`)
   - You can use [@username_to_id_bot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot) to find this ID

### Step 3: Fork This Repository

1. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository
2. This creates your own copy of the project in your GitHub account

### Step 4: Set Up Repository Secrets

1. In your forked repository, go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add two new repository secrets:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot token from Step 1
   - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Your chat ID from Step 2

### Step 5: Customize Your Job Search

Edit the `get_data.py` file in your fork to customize your job search parameters:

```python
# Change these values to match your preferences
SEARCH_TERMS = [
    'ai engineer',
    'python developer',
    'data scientist',
    # Add your own search terms here
]

JOB_SITES = ["indeed", "glassdoor", "linkedin"]
LOCATION = "Netherlands"  # Change to your desired location
RESULTS_PER_SEARCH = 40
MAX_AGE_DAYS = 7
EXCLUDED_TERMS = ['PhD', 'Manager', 'Intern']  # Terms to exclude from results

```

###  Step 6: Enable GitHub Actions
Go to the "Actions" tab in your forked repository
Click the green button to enable workflows
The workflow is configured to run at 11 AM and 5 PM daily (you can modify this schedule in main.yml)
### Step 7: Trigger Your First Run
From the Actions tab, select the "Build Docker image and deploy to Heroku" workflow
Click "Run workflow" and select "Run workflow" from the dropdown
Wait for the workflow to complete (this may take a few minutes)
You should receive a test message in your Telegram chat
